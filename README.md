If you're working with Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for your **UPI Transaction Fraud Prediction Model** and want to maintain a structured GitHub repository, follow this **recommended folder structure**:

## **ðŸ“‚ UPI-Fraud-Detection (Root Project Directory)**
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Explanation of Each Folder**
1. **`data/`** â€“ Stores datasets (raw and processed). Keep raw data separate to ensure reproducibility.  
2. **`notebooks/`** â€“ Jupyter Notebooks for different stages (EDA, preprocessing, training, tuning, deployment).  
3. **`src/`** â€“ Python scripts for modularity (data processing, model training, evaluation, and prediction).  
4. **`models/`** â€“ Trained ML models (`.pkl`, `.h5`, `.joblib`) for future use.  
5. **`logs/`** â€“ Logs for monitoring model training and debugging errors.  
6. **`reports/`** â€“ Documentation on model performance, fraud detection analysis, and insights.  
7. **`README.md`** â€“ Essential documentation for project setup and usage.  
8. **`.gitignore`** â€“ Prevents unnecessary files from being pushed to GitHub (e.g., datasets, logs, models).

### **ðŸ“Œ Best Practices**
- **Use Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration & experimentation (`notebooks/` folder).  
- **Move reusable code** (preprocessing, model training) into `src/` for modularity.  
- **Version control your models** â€“ Save trained models (`models/` folder) to avoid retraining every time.  
- **Use a `.gitignore` file** â€“ Avoid committing large datasets and temporary files.
